# agentic-sdd-pipeline

A research-first open-source project about building an **agentic programming pipeline** around **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)**.

This repository focuses on a practical constraint that many real systems have:

- you may have **Skills**
- you may have **Subagents**
- you may have **Hooks**
- but you may **not** have full-blown **Agent Teams**

The goal of this project is to explore how far a disciplined, artifact-driven SDD workflow can go in that environment.

---

## What this repo is about

This project studies how to build an AI coding workflow that is:

- faster than traditional handoffs
- more reliable than raw vibe coding
- structured enough for real engineering work
- composable with Skills + Subagents + Hooks
- suitable for future system design and implementation

In short:

> **Use specifications, plans, tasks, validation artifacts, and lightweight hooks to turn agentic coding into an engineering pipeline.**

---

## Current status

This repository has now moved beyond pure research notes.

It currently contains:

- shareable background research
- v1 system design docs
- a lightweight v1 definition
- stage rules
- minimal artifact templates
- hook skeletons
- a tiny runnable scaffold for initializing a feature folder

This means the repo now contains a **lightweight runnable skeleton**, not just theory.

---

## Why this matters

Modern coding agents are increasingly capable of:

- exploring repositories
- generating code
- debugging iteratively
- applying patches across multiple files
- running tests and reacting to failures

But they still struggle when:

- requirements are vague
- architecture is implicit
- constraints are scattered
- tasks are too large
- no validation gates exist

That is exactly where **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** becomes useful.

SDD shifts the workflow from:

```text
prompt -> code -> patch problems later
```

to:

```text
intent -> spec -> plan -> tasks -> implementation -> validation
```

## Current thesis

The working thesis of this repo is:

> A serious agentic coding system does **not** need heavyweight agent-team orchestration first.
> It can start with **one orchestrator**, **phase-specific Skills**, **specialized Subagents**, a strong **artifact model**, and a small set of **Hooks**.

That means a practical v1 can be built around:

- one orchestrator agent
- explicit phases
- reusable Skills for each phase
- Subagents for specialized execution
- Hooks for stage gating and scaffolding
- feature folders with traceable artifacts
- validation and retrospective loops

## Runnable lightweight v1

The current repo includes a minimal runnable path.

### What it can do right now

- scaffold a feature folder
- create baseline artifacts from templates
- gate stage transitions using hooks
- check implementation prerequisites before entering implementation

### Quick demo

```sh
./scripts/init-feature.sh 001 demo-search "Demo Search"
./scripts/execute-stage.sh ./features/001-demo-search intake
./scripts/complete-artifact.sh ./features/001-demo-search 00-intake.md
./scripts/execute-stage.sh ./features/001-demo-search spec
./scripts/complete-artifact.sh ./features/001-demo-search 01-spec.md
```

After this, the feature folder contains:

- `00-intake.md`
- `01-spec.md`
- `02-plan.md`
- `06-tasks.md`
- `07-implementation-log.md`
- `08-validation.md`
- `state.json`

This is intentionally minimal, but it is enough to prove the workflow skeleton is executable.

A small real pilot utility has also been added:

```sh
./scripts/feature-summary.sh ./features/002-runtime-demo
```

This prints a lightweight summary of a feature folder's current state and core artifact presence.

## Recommended maturity model

This repo currently treats SDD as having three practical maturity levels:

### 1. Spec-First
- write the spec before coding
- already much better than pure vibe coding
- good starting point

### 2. Spec-Anchored
- keep the spec alive after implementation
- use it for evolution, review, and maintenance
- recommended target for a real internal pipeline

### 3. Spec-as-Source
- spec becomes the primary long-term editable artifact
- powerful, but too aggressive for most v1 systems

**Recommended starting point:**

- start with **Spec-First + Spec-Anchored**
- avoid jumping directly to full **Spec-as-Source**
